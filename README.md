# JPP-interpreter

This is the interpreter for language "TIPA - The Imperative Programming Astonishing Language".

Nearly all of the functionalities declared in the language declaration were implemented. 
I've only decided to drop index-based access to tuples, as there were some problems with static type checking.

In order to build the interpreter, just call "make" in the main directory, this will create "interpreter" file, which can be the. called with the name of the program that we want to execute.
